# Image Processing Application

This project provides an interactive web-based application for **image generation and inpainting** using state-of-the-art diffusion models. Built with **Streamlit** and powered by **Hugging Face Diffusers**, the app enables users to upload images, mask regions for inpainting, and generate/edit images using natural-language prompts.

## Introduction

Recent advances in generative models make realistic image editing accessible through simple text instructions. This application wraps model inference into a small Streamlit interface so users can experiment with prompt-driven image generation and inpainting without complex setup.

## Problem Definition

Manual image editing is time-consuming and often requires skill with graphical tools. The goal of this project is to provide an **easy-to-use interface** that allows users to:
- Generate images from text prompts.
- Edit parts of existing images by masking (inpainting).
- Quickly iterate on prompts and settings to produce desired outputs.

## Features

- **Text-to-Image Generation** using diffusion models.
- **Inpainting**: mask a region of an input image and fill it according to a prompt.
- **Streamlit UI**: lightweight interactive frontend for experimentation.
- **GPU support**: uses PyTorch/CUDA when available for faster inference.
- **Simple deployment**: runs locally or can be exposed using tools like `localtunnel` or ngrok.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
